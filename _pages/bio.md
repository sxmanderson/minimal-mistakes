As a musician I've been in various performing bands since high school. My longest tenure was as the lead vocalist/bassist in the Concern, a high-energy trio described as "prog-punk" and "like Touch and Go meets the Minutemen." The Concern recorded two albums, performed over 100 shows and was a regular fixture at the 231 Gallery, Marquette's legendary art gallery and venue. I've also sung and played bass, guitar and keys in various rock, folk and roots-country outfits, as well as some guitar work in the pit orchestra at the Historic Vista Theater.

I'm also involved with local community theater. The most interesting experience was my role as Lou in "Waiting for Orson," which performed at the 2014 New York International Fringe Festival in Manhattan, and subsequently at the Chicago Fringe Festival later that year. More locally, my roles have included Tom Collins in "RENT," Brad Majors (2012) and Riff-Raff (2011) in "The Rocky Horror Show," and various minor roles and duties in smaller plays, one-acts and productions. 

In my off hours I enjoy weightlifting and reading. Weightlifting is a new passion, but its effect on my mood and mental acuity has been noticeable... so much so that it was worth losing some beloved pairs of jeans to the effects of thrice-weekly squatting. As a bookworm I average about a book per week, and my favorites include Borges, Beckett, Paley and Pratchett.

It might be good to have some pictures in this, like NY, or a Concern shot. Add some flavor.
