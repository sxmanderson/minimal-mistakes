**Hiya!** 

I'm Luke, software engineer from the Midwest, and this is my webpage/digital resume. I come fully stocked with a bachelor's degree in computer science and over two years' industry experience in both Windows and Linux environments, primarily in .NET and C# programming, SQL, web programming, and scripting.
