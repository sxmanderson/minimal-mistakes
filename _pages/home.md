**Hiya!** 

I'm Luke, experienced software engineer, and this is my webpage/digital resume. 

I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from Northern Michigan University and over two years' industry experience in both Windows and Linux environments. My professional work has focused mainly on .NET and C# applications, SQL Server, web programming, and scripting. I currently work for TelNet Worldwide, where I was named the Team Member of the Quarter for Q4 2016. My yearly performance reviews consistently range between "Exceeds" to "Greatly Exceeds" expectations, and have included such plaudits as:

- "He learns new tech easily."

- "Luke has shown a very steady approach to analysis and troubleshooting, both in a support and development role."

- "Luke has excelled and prospered in every area and has been truly enjoyable to see him flourish."

- "The highlight of what he did last review period... was a huge undertaking, he had little help since the last developer to work on it is no longer with the company.  He was able to pull it all together and it is being successfully used by the agents."

I'm currently open to job offers. If you're hiring for a challenging position that can offer a team environment with defined goals and opportunity for growth, please contact me via one of the links to the left, or at the number listed on [my resume](/resume.html).
